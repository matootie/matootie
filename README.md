<p>Hi. I'm <em>Mateja</em>, or, <strong>matootie</strong>. I started programming in high school because it was fun, and I'm still riding that wave. I'm always interested in working on new projects. I don't use much social media, <em>aside from GitHub if you count that</em>, so if you would like to get in contact with me, good old fashion email works best. You know where to find it.</p>
