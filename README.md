<h3 align="center">Hello, friend!</h3>

<hr />

<p><em>When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to program
<br />I definitely wanted to become a software engineer.
<br />It was almost impossible because -it was- the dream was so big
<br />That I didn't see any chance because
<br />I was living in a big city; was studying
<br />And when I finally broke away from school and became a programmer
<br />I thought, "Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance"
<br />Because all I really wanted to do is program
<br /><a href="https://genius.com/Daft-punk-giorgio-by-moroder-lyrics" target="_blank">And not only program, but create software</a></em></p>

<hr />

<p>I'm always looking to collaborate on projects. I don't use social media, so if you would like to get in contact with me, email works best. You know where to find it.</p>
